# Parts #

# Notes #
* First version will be crank-driven, can add a motor later if need be.
* Distance between the two drums is controlled by a round insert with an offset hole for the licker-in axle, rotating this will move the two drums closer/further from each other.
* Higher ratio between drums cards better but requires more crank revolutions for the same amount of carding.

# Outstanding Questions #
* How will the drum spacing adjustment inserts be attached/made?
* Static? How do deal w static?
